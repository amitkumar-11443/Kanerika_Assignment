## Dataset Preparation and EDA Purpose
This document outlines the process for handling the dataset and preparing it for modeling. It covers steps for data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier treatment, feature scaling, train-test splitting, Model Training and evaluation, Model Evaluation Metrics, Model Hyperparameter tuning. 

## Detailed Steps

1. **Load the Dataset**
   - Import the dataset using pandas to understand its structure and identify the columns.
   
2. **Ignore the "ID" Column**
   - The "ID" column does not contribute to the analysis or predictive modeling and should be dropped.

3. **Impute Missing Values**
   - For numerical variables, use the mean to fill missing values.
   - For categorical variables, use the most frequent value (mode) to fill missing values.
   - However, there was no missing value in the provided dataset

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Box Plot**
     Generate box plots for each numerical variable to visualize outliers.
   - **Correlation Matrix**
     Create a correlation matrix to understand the relationships between variables.
   - **Distribution of Data**
     Plot histograms or density plots to examine the distribution of the data for each variable.

5. **Outlier Treatment**
   - Use the Z-score method to identify and treat outliers in the dataset.

6. **Feature Scaling**
   - Apply feature scaling (e.g. Min Max Scaler) to ensure that all numerical variables contribute equally to the analysis.

7. **Train-Test Split**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of predictive models. The "SalePrice" column is the target variable, and the rest are feature variables.



8. **Regression Algorithms**
   - Linear Regression
   - Lasso Regression
   - Ridge Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Elastic Net Regression
   - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression
   - Neural Networks/Deep Learning

9. **Model Evaluation**
   - Perform cross-validation
   - Tune hyperparameters
   - Evaluate using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

10. **Results**
   - Compare performance metrics
   - Visualize model outputs

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy
- seaborn
- pandas

## Conclusion
Following these steps will prepare the dataset for modeling, ensuring that it is clean, properly imputed, and scaled. It was found that the "Elastic Net Regression" gave the best reasult.
